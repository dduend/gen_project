could\nI still haven't heard from your family\nBut you said your mom always loved me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSometimes I go blurry-eyed\nSmall talk and you tell me that you're on fire\nLights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever\n\n[Chorus]\nI see the look in your eye and I'm bitin' my tongue\nYou'll be the love of my life when I was young\nWhen the night is over\nDon't call me up, I'm already under\nI get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again\nI'll be the love of your life inside your head\nWhen the night is over\nDon't call me up, I'm already under\n\n[Verse 2]\nAudrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock\nJust because you're hurtin' doesn't mean I'm not\nIf it doesn't go away by the time I turn thirty\nI made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm

floor\nAnd the faint overhearing\nOf my mom on the phone\nThrough the walls of my bedroom\nThings that I shouldn't know\nThink the bus might be broken\n'Cause the shocks never work\nWe're collectively hopin'\nThat the drive will be short\nPeople 24/7\nIt's the best and a curse\nAll they do is remind me\nThat I'm still introverted\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so high, but can't look down\nLeft my past life on the ground\nThink I'm more alive somehow\nI feel like myself right now\n\n[Verse 2]\nPretty far from the ocean\nNever thought that would hurt\nEvery lake here is frozen\nWhich is makin' it worse\nThis is somebody's hometown\nNever been here before\nWritin' down every street sign\nMissed the spellin', I'm sure\nAnd I ended a friendship\nOn the day that I left\nAnd though I really meant it\nIt still makes me upset\nAm I losin' my family\nEvery minute I'm gone?\nWhat if my little brother\nThinks my leavin' was wrong?\nOh, oh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm so high, but can't look down\nLeft my past life on the ground\nThink I'm more alive somehow\nI feel like myself right now\nI'm so tired, but can't sit down\nWhat if this is it for now?\nThink I'm more alive somehow\nI feel like myself

proud, 'cause I'm just scared of you shootin' it down\nYou can just talk and I'll stare at your mouth\nIt could be bad, but I won't find out\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I wake up, in the middle of the

one more time\n\"Enjoy your youth,\" I'm gonna cry\nAnd I don't stick up for myself\nI'm anxious, and nothing can help\nAnd I wish I'd done this before\nAnd I wish people liked me more\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I did was try my best\nThis the kinda thanks I get?\nUnrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)\nThey say these are the golden years\nBut I wish I could disappear\nEgo crush is so

Nightmare or dream?\nSo disorienting, who knows what they mean?\nDream or nightmare?

Why should I start\nTo begin to heal when I would need to restart\nMan, I don't want this, I'm so numb to the conflict\nAnd uninvolved with my own life, I'm too cautious\nI have been lonely, here's how it feels\nUnshakeable shame from mistakes through the years\nI would lie in my room as I'd cower in fear\nAs I'd peer at my peers through my bottled-up tears\nBut bottled-up tears don't do no good for nobody\nLet it all out, don't hold onto that ocean\nWe hold it all in 'cause we swallow our own\nConceived notions of who we're supposed to be\nAnd when we don't live up to what is expected\nWe feel so pathetic, like who could accept us?\nYou betrayed yourself but it's all your perspective\n'Cause God would accept you but you choose rejection\nSee? And that's the biggest problem\nThey holding on to the pain [?] solve them\nYou making bad decisions every time you feel exhausted\nFeeling empty inside so you cope with emptyin' your wallet\nAnd being bitter only makes you the villain in the end\n'Cause it's like poison to the soul that you keep taking in\nAnd you keep getting injured hoping that one day you'll win\nYou're at the finish line looking for where to begin\nWhat I'm really tryna say is you're not making progress\nIt takes time so be patient, it's a long process\nForgive the people who hurt you, I know it's hard, you got this\n'Cause it's the only way to heal from all the pain they caused youEmbed", "release_date": "August 3, 2022", "genius_link": "https://genius.com/Cast-of-high-school-musical-the-musical-the-series-you-never-know-lyrics", "pic": "https://images.genius.com/982b4c157405e2a54dcf0d7d9bd4899e.1000x1000x1.png"}, {"artist_id": 3, "song_name": "\u200bcardigan", "song_lyrics": "287 ContributorsTranslationsNederlandsTurkceEspanolSrpskiRusskiiRomanaPortuguesfrsyItalianoBahasa IndonesiaMagyarDeutschFrancaisHrvatskiChinese TraditionalEllenikaUkrayins'kaPolskiSlovenscinal`rby@Catalahangugeo cardigan Lyrics[Verse 1]\nVintage tee, brand new phone\nHigh heels on cobblestones\nWhen you are young, they assume you know nothing\nSequin smile, black lipstick\nSensual politics\nWhen you are young, they assume you know nothing\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I knew you\nDancin' in your Levi's\nDrunk under a streetlight, I\nI knew you\nHand under my sweatshirt\nBaby, kiss it better, I\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan\nUnder someone's bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\n[Verse 2]\nA friend to all is a friend to none\nChase two girls, lose the one\nWhen you are young, they assume you know nothing\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $378You might also like[Chorus]\nBut I knew you\nPlaying hide-and-seek and\nGiving me your weekends, I\nI knew you\nYour heartbeat on the High Line\nOnce in twenty lifetimes, I\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan\nUnder someone's bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite\n\n[Bridge]\nTo kiss in cars and downtown bars\nWas all we needed\nYou drew stars around my scars\nBut now I'm bleedin'\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I knew you\nSteppin' on the last train\nMarked me like a bloodstain, I\nI knew you\nTried to change the ending\nPeter losing Wendy, I\nI knew you\nLeavin' like a father\nRunning like water, I\nAnd when you are young, they assume you know nothing\n[Verse 3]\nBut I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss\nI knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long\n'Cause I knew everything when I was young\nI knew I'd curse you for the longest time\nChasin' shadows in the grocery line\nI knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired\nAnd you'd be standin' in my front porch light\nAnd I knew you'd come back to me\nYou'd come back to me\nAnd you'd come back to me\nAnd you'd come back\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd when I felt like I was an old cardigan\nUnder someone's bed\nYou put me on and said I was your favorite173Embed", "release_date": "July 24, 2020", "genius_link": "https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cardigan-lyrics", "pic": "https://images.genius.com/282838f51b2395aba0e0084dd02f1774.1000x1000x1.png"}, {"artist_id": 3, "song_name": "\u200bdeja vu", "song_lyrics": "5 ContributorsMaxenn's Transcriptions LyricsMost Popular Scribes\n2,500,000+ views (8)\n* \"GOOBA\" - 6ix9ine | 4,1 million+\n* \"As It Was\" - Harry Styles | 3,8 million+\n* \"The Box\" - Roddy Ricch | 3,5 million+\n* \"cardigan\" - Taylor Swift | 3,1 million+\n* \"deja vu\" - Olivia Rodrigo | 2,7 million+\n* \"good 4 u\" - Olivia Rodrigo | 2,7 million+\n* \"MONTERO (CMBYN)\" - Lil Nas X | 2,5 million+\n* \"Good Days\" - SZA | 2,5 million+\n2,500,000 - 1,000,000 views (27)\n* \"Life Is Good\" - Future ft.

is no amount\nOf crying I can do for you\nAll this time\nWe always walked a very thin line\nYou didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)\nYou never gave a warning sign (I gave so many

if a little loud\nThe doctor had told him to settle down\nIt must have been her fault his heart gave out\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd they said\n\"There goes the last great American dynasty\nWho knows, if she

Lyricshello! my name is Olivia! if you're reading this, you probably heard of my album SOUR. I made most of the songs when I was 17 & I'm super proud of the way it captures the strange feelings of that slice of my life. I wrote most of the songs in my bedroom & finish and produced them with my friend Dan Nigro. I've always loved writing music, but creating this album with Dan was one of the greatest joys of my life. I'm writing this before it has come out but I really hope that the songs resonate with people & make them feel a little less alone. Anyway I thought I would share some of the inspiration for SOUR with you guys & show you a little bit of how it was made.' Hope you enjoy!!!\n\n1. brutal\nBrutal is the first song of the record but the last song I wrote. if that makes any sense. it's really weird & intense which I love. Dan & I wrote it together about two weeks before we had to to turn in the album. The day we wrote it, we went on a drive to go get lunch & take a break from the studio. As we drove around, Dan played me some of his fav 90s grunge songs. I looove 90s grunge & I told him I wanted to write a song like the ones he was playing me. so when we got back to the studio, he came up with this really, simple, sick riff & we wrote brutal! The day before, I over heard someone talk about how \"brutal\" the entertainment industry was & I remember thinking the word was so interesting & descriptive. I love brutality (haha you get it) honest borderline pathetic lyrics & so we tried to do that in the verses. it's one of my favs songs on the record & I rlly hope you like it!\n\n2. traitor\nI wrote most of traitor on my bedroom floor in Salt Lake City. I sort of forgot about it until I sent a bunch of voice memos to Dan & he said he liked this one. We finished it up together & I really like the way it turned out. It sort of feels like and old country song to me which I'm obsessed with.\n\n3. drivers license\nmy first real published song. I literally still can't believe how big it got. Super grateful for everyone who listened. I've talked about how drivers license came to be in like every interview I've ever done, so I'll spare you guys the boring details.\n\n4. 1 step forward, 3 steps back\nI wrote this song in like March of 2020. The day I wrote it, my mom and I were doing a roadtrip from L.A to Salt Lake City. I was obsessed with Taylor Swift's reputation then and we literally played the whole album over & over the entire 10 hour car drive. I have the best mom ever haha. During that same trip I got a text from someone who was telling me something about their diet or productivity (I don't really remember) & they described their progress as \"always one step forward and three steps back\". I had never really heard anyone use that phrase before & I thought it was super cool. when I got home, I decided to take that phrase & write a song over the stunning chords in \" New Year's Day . \" When it came time to put out the album, Jack Antonoff & Taylor Swift, who wrote \"New Year's Day\" aka my favorite love song of all time, were kind enough to approve my reimagining\n\n5. deja vu\ndeja vu was the most stubborn song I've ever made lol. It took Dan & me soo long to get the mix to a good place. We wrote it about a month after we made drivers license and I really liked its unique sound. I'm also literally obsessed with the music video for it. An amazing woman named Allie Avital directed it & my friend Talia Ryder stared in it with me. It was soo much fun.\n\n6. good 4 u\nGood 4 u is my favorite song on the record. I struggled for a really long time to write upbeat songs because I thought in order to write them I had to talk about being happy or being in love. When I was writing this album I wasn't really feeling any of those joyous feelings lol. good 4 u perfectly captures my feelings of heartbreak in a way that feels really fun. I listen to it while I'm driving sometimes & it feels sort of energizing. I'm super stoked to play it live one day eek!\n\n7. enough for you\nI wrote \"enough for you\" entirely by myself which I'm really proud of. I think its probably the best song I've ever written currently. I really love not only the honesty & vulnerability in it but the hope. In an album full of sad break-up songs, this songs feels like a light at the end of the tunnel, a promise that the feeling wouldn't be forever. The entire song is really just my voice & an acoustic guitar which I think is sick.\n\n8. happier\n\"happier\" was the first song I wrote on this record, well, I supposed I didn't know I was ever gonna get to make a record then but nonetheless funnily enough, I actually wrote it in between takes of this super poppy dance number in a show I was filming, which is so ironic. It was one of those songs that the universe gives to people like magic. It felt like the entire song was fully formed, floating & I was just a channel it used to come to life. Woah I sound so fake deep I'm so sorry lol. No but its true, it was a really magical experience. And whats even cooler than that is the fact that this is the song that connected me & my fav colaborator, Dan. He saw a video of this song I posted on Instagram. DMed me, & the rest is history.\nSee Olivia Rodrigo LiveGet tickets as low as $689. jealousy, jealousy\nI wrote jealousy, jealousy with Casey Smith in summer 2020. I was obsessed with bass driven songs & really wanted to make one of my own. We wrote it about the pressures of social media & the terrible insecurity that comes with it. Growing up on the internet has completely distorted my reality in many occasions. I wrote this song during a time where it was hard to not only separate other peoples real life from their social media but my own life from my social media, if that makes any sense. Writing this song was really cathartic for me & I hope other people can relate to it in some way.\n\n10. favorite crime\nDan & I wrote favorite crime sometime last summer I think. I had \"know I loved you so bad I let you treat me like that\" written in my notes app for a while & it sort of sparked the entire song. I really love how the song is one big metaphor. Figurative language was something I had to work on in my songwriting. I'm a very literal, specific writer & similes aren't often where my brain tends to go, so I'm super proud of this song.\n\n11. hope ur ok\nhope ur ok is the last song on the record. It's a super special song to me & I love the stories it tells. I wrote most of it in my living room in early 2020, drawing inspiration from some of my favorites country & folk artists. I think my favorite lines I've ever written are \"hope he took his bad deal & made a royal flush\" & \"hope you know how proud I am you were created with the courage to unlearn all of their hatred.\" I had so much fun making it & I hope it gives optimism to someone out there just like it did for me.\n\nTHANK YOU\nthank YOU so much for listening to SOUR.

took him faster than you can say \"Sabotage\"\nI never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it\nI underestimated just who I was dealing with\nShe had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum\nShe underestimated just who she was stealing from\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's not a saint and she's not what you think\nShe's an actress, woah\nShe's better known for the things that she does\nOn the mattress, woah\nSoon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys\nOn the playground won't make you many friends\nShe should keep in mind, she should keep in mind\nThere is nothing I do better than revenge, ha\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list\nShe looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it\nI think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and\nShe thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things\nBut sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know\nOr pushing people down to get you where you wanna go\nOh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me\nBut no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity\n(Think about what you did)\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $378You might also

their mittens and coats\nAnd the cider would flow\nAnd I just wanna be there tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSweet dreams of holly and ribbon\nMistakes are forgiven\nAnd everythin' is icy and blue\nAnd you

up in your arms and our friends were laughin'\n'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them\nNow I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street\nFlashback to the night when you said to me\nThat

silhouette\nStarts to make its way to me\nThe playful conversation starts\nCounter all your quick remarks\nLike passing notes in secrecy\nAnd it was enchanting to meet you\nAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet you\n\n[Chorus]\nThis night is sparklin', don't you let it go\nI'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home\nI'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe lingering question kept me up\n2AM, who do you love?\nI wonder 'til I'm wide awake\nAnd now, I'm pacing back and forth\nWishing you were at my door\nI'd open up and you would say\n\"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you\"\nAll I know is I was enchanted to meet you\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $378You might also like[Chorus]\nThis night is sparklin', don't you

forever wonderin' if you knew\nI was enchanted to meet you\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is me praying that\nThis was the very first page\nNot where the storyline ends\nMy thoughts will echo your name\nUntil I see you again\nThese are the words I held back\nAs I was leaving too soon\nI was enchanted to meet you\nPlease, don't be in love with someone else\nPlease, don't have somebody waiting on you\nPlease,
